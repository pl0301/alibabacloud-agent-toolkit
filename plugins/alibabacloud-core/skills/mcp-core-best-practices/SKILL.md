# Alibaba Cloud MCP Core Best Practices

This skill documents the canonical patterns for using the `alibabacloud-core` MCP
server — the generalized OpenAPI MCP Server Core that covers all Alibaba Cloud
APIs without requiring pre-selection of specific operations.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AlibabaCloud___SearchApis` | Natural language search for APIs matching a requirement |
| `AlibabaCloud___CallCLI` | Execute a single CLI command remotely |
| `AlibabaCloud___GetApiDefinition` | Get full API definition (params, response, errors) by product/version/name |
| `AlibabaCloud___ListApis` | List all APIs for a product, optionally filtered |
| `AlibabaCloud___ListProductRegions` | List regions where a product is available |
| `AlibabaCloud___GenerateCLICommand` | Generate a CLI command from API definition + parameters |
| `AlibabaCloud___ListProducts` | List all Alibaba Cloud products |
| `AlibabaCloud___SearchDocument` | Search Alibaba Cloud documentation by keyword |
| `AlibabaCloud___ReadDocument` | Read a specific documentation page by URL |
| `AlibabaCloud___RunScript` | Start a restricted Python task with structured Alibaba Cloud OpenAPI access |
| `AlibabaCloud___GetTask` | Long-poll a `RunScript` task until approval, execution, or failure reaches a terminal state |

## Standard Workflow

### 1. API Discovery

When the target API is unknown, use `AlibabaCloud___SearchApis` with a natural
language description of the requirement. Each query should be granular enough to
map to a single API call.

For known products, use `AlibabaCloud___ListApis` with a filter keyword to browse
available operations.

### 2. API Inspection

Once the target API is identified, use `AlibabaCloud___GetApiDefinition` to
retrieve the full definition including:

- Required and optional parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes

### 3. Command Generation

Use `AlibabaCloud___GenerateCLICommand` to produce a correct CLI command from the
API definition and user-provided parameters. This avoids manual CLI syntax errors.

### 4. Execution Choice

Use `AlibabaCloud___CallCLI` for one known `aliyun ...` command when no later
call depends on its response. Verified example:
`AlibabaCloud___CallCLI(command="aliyun ecs DescribeRegions --region cn-hangzhou")`.

Use `AlibabaCloud___RunScript` when the answer needs structured OpenAPI
`call_cli(...)`: pagination, List-to-Describe enrichment, cross-resource
comparison, multi-region/multi-product collection, permission checks, OSS
body/bytes handling, response-driven follow-up calls, or custom result shaping.
Example: fetch identity, list resources, and perform follow-up Describe/Get
calls in one script instead of separate tool round-trips.

Do not split one user task across multiple `RunScript` submissions just to
inspect intermediate data. Put discovery, pagination, filtering, and follow-up
Describe/Get calls in one self-contained script and return via `result`.

### 5. Single-Call Execution

Use `AlibabaCloud___CallCLI` to execute the generated command. Key constraints:

- Commands must start with `aliyun`
- No shell pipes, redirections, or operators
- No shell variables or command substitution
- No local file path references (MCP server is remote)

### 6. Scripted Multi-Call Execution

`AlibabaCloud___RunScript` starts a sandboxed Python task and waits up to 20
seconds. It may return `result` directly; otherwise use the returned `processID`
and `nextAction` with `AlibabaCloud___GetTask`. The script's OpenAPI access goes
through injected `call_cli()` only:

```python
identity = await call_cli(product='Sts', action='GetCallerIdentity',
                          params={}, version='2015-04-01')
result = {'has_account_id': 'AccountId' in identity}
```

RunScript essentials:

- `call_cli()` is structured OpenAPI, not CLI text. Never pass `aliyun ...`.
- Before unfamiliar APIs, OSS APIs, body/object params, array params, or
  parameter retries, call `AlibabaCloud___GetApiDefinition` separately.
- Top-level `params` keys must match OpenMeta `parameters[].name`. RPC APIs
  often use `RegionId`; OSS APIs often use `bucket`, `max-keys`, `x-oss-acl`,
  or `body`.
- Arrays/objects stay as Python lists/dicts unless the API parameter itself is
  JSON text.
- For OSS object bytes, `PutObject` accepts bytes in `params['body']` and
  `GetObject` returns bytes in `Body`.
- `version`, `region`, and `endpoint` are optional; still pass API region fields
  such as `RegionId` when the API defines them.
- Assign final output to `result`. Do not pass credentials, profiles, shell
  flags, or host file paths. Use `/tmp` only for small sandbox scratch files.
- The script must have a reachable module-level `call_cli()`; pure Python
  payloads fail validation.
- Do not write `import` or comments. Safe modules such as `asyncio`, `json`,
  `math`, `re`, `time`, and `uuid` are pre-imported.
- Do not use sensitive names such as `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`,
  `globals`, `locals`, `getattr`, `setattr`, or `vars`; do not use private or
  dunder attributes, dynamic `.format()` tricks, subprocesses, or network code.
- Do not target CLI meta products such as `configure`, `plugin`, `ossutil`,
  `ossutil64`, `upgrade`, or `mock`. Some OSS APIs are unsupported; if the
  validator returns `UnsupportedOssApi`, choose a supported OSS OpenAPI action
  or another tool.
- Discover IDs inside the script, paginate every list call, and never sample or
  truncate complete inventory/compliance answers.
- List APIs are not enough for attribute checks. Follow List with Describe/Get
  and feature-specific APIs for every resource.
- Verify response shape before saying "0 found"; list responses often wrap arrays
  twice, e.g. `{"Instances":{"Instance":[...]}}`.
- Use `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` for parallel calls. Treat
  expected NotFound as "not configured" for optional features.
- Do exact aggregation in Python; return raw fields for judgment calls such as
  "misconfigured" or "risky".

OSS object read/write example (use a user-approved temporary bucket/key):

```python
bucket = '<approved-bucket>'
key = 'run-script-probe/example.txt'
content = b'hello-from-run-script\n'
put = await call_cli(product='Oss', action='PutObject',
                     params={'bucket': bucket, 'key': key, 'body': content},
                     version='2019-05-17', region='cn-hangzhou')
got = await call_cli(product='Oss', action='GetObject',
                     params={'bucket': bucket, 'key': key},
                     version='2019-05-17', region='cn-hangzhou')
result = {'put_ok': isinstance(put, dict), 'round_trip_ok': got.get('Body') == content}
```

### 7. RunScript Task Polling

After `AlibabaCloud___RunScript`, inspect `nextAction`:

| `nextAction` | Meaning | Agent action |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| `None` | Task succeeded | Use `result` |
| `CallGetTask` | Initial call is not terminal | Call `AlibabaCloud___GetTask` with the same `processID` |
| `CallGetTaskAgain` | Poll timed out and task is still not terminal | Call `AlibabaCloud___GetTask` again with the same `processID` |
| `Stop` | Validation failed, approval rejected/expired, task expired, or process missing | Stop; do not retry automatically |
| `InspectError` | Execution failed | Inspect `error`; failed OpenAPI calls appear in `error.failedCall` when available |

`AlibabaCloud___GetTask` parameters:

- `processID`: required, from `RunScript`.
- `waitTimeoutSeconds`: optional, capped at 30 seconds by the server. Use `0`
  for an immediate status check.
- `pollIntervalSeconds`: optional polling interval, between 1 and 10 seconds.

Human approval handling:

- `ApprovalPending` with `approvalReqId` means external approval is required.
  Ask the user to complete approval or rejection out of band, then call
  `AlibabaCloud___GetTask` again with the same `processID`.
- Do not call `AlibabaCloud___RunScript` again while waiting for approval or
  execution; that creates a new process instead of continuing the current one.
- `ApprovalRejected` and `ApprovalExpired` are terminal. Stop and report the
  approval result.

### 8. Cross-Account Execution

**IMPORTANT**: For any operation involving member accounts, cross-account queries,
or Resource Directory account resolution, you MUST first load the
`multi-account-query` skill (invoke it via the Skill tool) before proceeding.
That skill contains the complete workflow for alias-to-UID resolution, pagination
handling, and proper use of `x_assume_account_id`. Do not attempt cross-account
operations without reading it first.

For Resource Directory member accounts, pass additional parameters to
`AlibabaCloud___CallCLI`:

| Parameter | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `x_assume_account_id` | Target member account UID |
| `x_assume_role_name` | Custom role name (default: `ResourceDirectoryAccountAccessRole`) |
| `x_assume_role_arn` | Full role ARN (highest priority) |

Priority: `x_assume_role_arn` > `x_assume_account_id` + `x_assume_role_name` >
default configuration.

## CLI Command Constraints

When using `AlibabaCloud___CallCLI`, the following are NOT supported:

- Bash/zsh pipes (`|`) or shell operators
- `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, or other shell tools
- Shell redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`)
- Command substitution (`$()`)
- Shell variables or environment variables
- Local file paths (`file://`, `fileb://`)

For commands that need local file access (e.g., `ossutil cp`), use the Bash tool
directly instead of MCP.

## Region Handling

- Use `AlibabaCloud___ListProductRegions` to check product availability in a
  specific region before making calls.
- Always include `--region` when operating across regions or when the default
  region may not match the target.

## Documentation Access

- `AlibabaCloud___SearchDocument`: Find relevant docs by keyword.
- `AlibabaCloud___ReadDocument`: Read full content of a known documentation URL.

Use these to verify behavior, understand quotas, or find configuration guides
that are not captured in API definitions alone.

## Error Handling Patterns

- **InvalidParameter**: Check parameter names and values against
  `GetApiDefinition` output.
- **AccessDenied / Forbidden**: Verify RAM permissions for the current identity.
- **Throttling**: Retry with backoff; do not loop aggressively.
- **RegionNotSupported**: Use `ListProductRegions` to find valid regions.
- **RunScript ValidationFailed**: Fix unsafe or invalid Python authoring patterns
  before submitting a new `RunScript`.
- **RunScript BLK-4002**: Add a reachable module-level `call_cli()`; pure Python
  scripts are rejected.
- **RunScript Failed / InspectError**: Inspect `error`; if the script needs
  correction, submit one new corrected `RunScript`.

## Skill Discovery (Fallback)

The in-plugin skills (`alibabacloud-sdk-usage`, `alibabacloud-cli-guidance`,
`alibabacloud-terraform-usage`, `multi-account-query`) cover SDK codegen,
CLI guidance, Terraform HCL, and cross-account queries. They do not cover
purpose-built operational solutions, less common products, or end-to-end
workflows that the Alibaba Cloud team publishes as standalone skills.

When the user's request falls outside the in-plugin coverage, defer to
`alibabacloud-find-skills` instead of forcing a generic SDK or CLI synthesis.

### Invoke `alibabacloud-find-skills` when ANY of the following is true

- The user explicitly asks to search, browse, install, or discover an
  Alibaba Cloud skill (e.g., "有没有 RDS 备份的 skill", "find an OSS skill",
  "帮我装一个阿里云 skill")
- The request describes an **operational solution pattern** likely already
  packaged — batch operations, automated audits, key/credential rotation,
  scheduled cleanup, disaster recovery setup, incident response runbooks
- The target product or feature is not covered by any in-plugin skill —
  examples: MaxCompute, PAI, Quick BI, Function Compute lifecycle ops,
  CloudMonitor automation, custom service-linked workflows
- A first-cut SDK/CLI synthesis would require **3+ chained API calls plus
  retry/pagination/error semantics** — a packaged skill usually captures the
  pattern more reliably than ad-hoc code

### Do NOT invoke `alibabacloud-find-skills` when

- The task is a single `CallCLI` / `GetApiDefinition` / one-shot SDK call
  (use the in-plugin skills directly)
- The user explicitly wants generated SDK code, raw CLI commands, or
  Terraform HCL (those map cleanly to in-plugin skills)
- The same workflow already triggered `find-skills` earlier in this
  conversation and returned no match — don't re-search the same intent

### Handoff pattern

1. Briefly tell the user you're searching the official catalog for a
   purpose-built skill
2. Invoke `alibabacloud-find-skills` via the Skill tool — it handles
   search, presentation, and install in its own workflow
3. After install, follow the installed skill's instructions to complete
   the request; do not fall back to ad-hoc SDK/CLI synthesis once a
   matching skill is loaded

## Integration Guidance

When building stable workflows:

1. Use `SearchApis` to identify the correct API during development.
2. Use `GenerateCLICommand` to produce validated commands.
3. Use `RunScript` for workflows that require complete pagination,
   List-to-Describe enrichment, or multi-call analysis.
4. Capture the stable command or script patterns into a dedicated Skill.
5. Configure a safety policy to restrict the MCP connection to only the commands
   the Skill needs (for production use).

This progression — explore, validate, codify, restrict — ensures both flexibility
during development and safety in production.
